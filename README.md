# Elm FRP in Clojure and ClojureScript

You must be mad! Elm in Clojure?

They said it could not be done. But behold, it is done, and it is
awesome. Doubters and skeptics, the time of reckoning has begun!

Do you want to put "FUNCTIONAL" back in your Functional Reactive
Programming? Tired of "Reactive Extensions"? Well, look no further!

Elm is awesome, Elm is cool, and it's totally functional.

## Usage

Very ALPHA at the moment. Use for experimentation, fun, learning, joy,
edification, and wonder/amazement only.

Just look at the examples!

/src/examples/mario.cljs

Run `lein cljsbuild once mario`, then open `mario.html` in a browser.

To really learn this, look at [the thesis][thesis] written by Evan
Czaplicki himself.
